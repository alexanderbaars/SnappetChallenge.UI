Snappet Front-end Challenge
============

At [Snappet](http://www.snappet.org), we care about data and we care about code. When we interview for development positions, we want to see code and we want to discuss code. That's why we want candidates to show some work on our challenge. This challenge is not meant to cost you tons of time. A few hours should be enough. You could spend weeks on it, or half an hour. We understand that in 2 hours, you can only do so much. Don't worry about completeness, work on something that works and shows your skills.

### Task requirements

* Create a responsive HTML page to represent the designs `FED-{state}.png` found in the root of this project. The breakpoints are 1280 (desktop), 786 (tablet) and 544 (mobile).
* Use semantic, accessible and valid mark-up.
* Style the page so that it looks like the design. This can be done in CSS, SCSS, LESS – whatever you prefer.
* Write a small piece of JavaScript so that the 'Math grade 5' dropdown shows and hides multiple classes, such as 'Math grade 4' and 'Math Grade 3'.
* Use the icons in the `/assets` folder to help you when styling the page.


## Important considerations

* We work as much as possible with latest technolgies, such as flexboxes or svg fragment identifiers. Your minimal requirements are to make it work in IE10+ and the latest two versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Feel free to use technolgies such as `autoprefixer`.
* We don’t expect candidates to finish all of the styling detailed in the design (although you’ll get mega kudos if you manage to!).  Focus on making the parts that you do work on a good standard that reflects your ability.  We’d rather see a number of the components from the design styled well, than lots of incomplete components.
* Think about how the CSS you write can be used across other pages on the site.  We build our CSS in a component-driven way so show us that you can do that too.
* If you want to use a grid framework to help you out with the base layout, that’s completely fine.  Please don’t use a framework to do the majority of your styling though – we want to see an example of your own CSS, not that you can use a CSS framework.
* We understand you’re developing from a PNG and not a Sketch or Photoshop file – don’t get too hung up on exact colours of text or margins between elements.
* Don’t overcomplicate the JavaScript part of the task.  We just want to see that you know how to write basic JS. Feel free to use jQuery but do not use jQuery libraries such as [select2](https://select2.github.io/).

# Questions

* What approaches did you use when completing the challenge?  Do you use any CSS methodologies or techniques to help this approach?
I did not, I used plain css.
I challenged myself by creating a reactJS app for it. After building that I created a standalone-version of that. You can find in the standalone-html folder.

* If you had more time to spend on the challenge, what would you like to add to your solution?
I would like to dive into styled-components and redux for state-handling.

* What browsers should your solution work in?  What will happen if we test it in older browsers?
I tested the latest chrome, firefox, safari and IE11. 
In IE10 the title is missplaced.

* What's your favourite programming language? Why?
I am a great fan of javascript for its agility and the huge community it is building around itself.


Thank you for your time, we look forward to hearing from you!  
Thanks to the [JustEat Challenge](https://github.com/justeat/JustEat.Recruitment.UI) for providing inspiration.

Notes:

I didnt build the toggle button.
I didnt find time to align the objective-texts vertically in the rows.
I enjoyed the challenge as an excercise. Obviously I have a lot to learn.

Probably I broke all rules of styling websites. No mobile-first, little component based. All very rudimentary.

Best regards
